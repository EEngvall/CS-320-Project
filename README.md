-How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  
I believe the key to making sure your code is functional and secure is through testing.  Before this course I did not know about unit testing and would simply try as many different scenarios as I could think of myself and see what would work and what wouldn't.  Now that I have the ability and knowledge of unit testing it makes it much simpler to develop these scenarios and test them quickyl and efficiently. 

-How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I think starting with a customers or client's requirements and creating the outline of your program based on those needs is the best way.  By getting the client's needs up front you're able to determine not only if they are possible to accomplish but also the best way to incorporate and accomplish those needs. Making sure that these are fleshed out before starting the project can also reduce or eliminate any hiccups down the road. 

-How do I approach designing software?

My appaorch was much different before this course.  As I stated previously I would just kind of test everything myself, which made it very slow and time consuming whenever there was a bug or issue that I need to resolve.  By utilizing unit testing I can now design and write the code then design and write the test for it.  If the base code changes I still have the test designed and coded, meaning that I only need to redo half the work, and this gets compounded everytime a change is made to the base code.  Instead of having to manually run through tests each time I alter something I can now just run the unit tests and see if they pass.  This allows me much more time to focus on designing the interface or working on polishing the final product.
